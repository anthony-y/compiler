Anonymous structs

Check in typedef'd structs that they don't mention their own names unless it's a pointer.

Check that procs with return types have return statements.

When local procedures are implemented, proc calls will need to be checked using lookup_local or something else.

Should does_type_describe_expr even need to account for missing symbols? Maybe they should have already been resolved.
    //// Sort of already fixed this with just subfunctions that return necessary info back after doing common checking.

// Syntax

Allocate and zero out syntax
t: *T = alloct(1){0};
