//
// AST
//
AstBlocks should have have hashtables instead of linear arrays for declarations.
    Fix the subtree allocator leak.

Maybe add AstNode flags and NODE_CHECKED back in, and use a table to lookup any values that need to be returned.

//
// Checker
//

Check in typedef'd structs that they don't mention their own names unless it's a pointer.

Check that procs with return types have return statements.

When local procedures are implemented, proc calls will need to be checked using lookup_local or something else.

Should does_type_describe_expr even need to account for missing symbols? Maybe they should have already been resolved.
    //// Sort of already fixed this with just subfunctions that return necessary info back after doing common checking.

//
// Misc
//
Name table, then most likely can make type_table and symbol_table have Name* keys, which can just be compared directly instead of doing strcmp every time.

//
// Syntax
//

Allocate and zero out syntax
t: *T = alloct(1){0};
